## Goal 1: Understanding Client Side Routing

* `react-router` wraps React components as routes for your application

## Goal 2: Refactoring Our App's Folder Structure

### Explanation

* For "real world" applications of reasonable scale, adhering to a folder structure helps with consistency and team onboarding
* In the React world, there are "smart" and "dumb" components

  * "Dumb" components simply display data and state
* Folder structures are more a "Pirates Code" guideline vs. dogmatic view. Find what works best for you!
