# ReHacked (October 11, 2016): SPA Basics @ Women Who Code Tampa
### By [ReactJS Tampa Bay](http://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Tampa-Bay/)

## Introduction

Since its inception, one of the primary criticisms of React has been the complexity of build systems.  On top of adopting ES2015 syntax and transpiling with Babel, developers also had to acclimate themselves with Webpack.

Thanks to the `create-react-app` scaffolder by Facebook, beginners to the React ecosystem can get going extremely quickly without the upfront investment of knowledge in these tools.
