# ReHacked (October 11, 2016): SPA Basics @ Women Who Code Tampa
### By [ReactJS Tampa Bay](http://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Tampa-Bay/)

Welcome to **ReHacked: SPA Basics @ Women Who Code Tampa**! In this lab we will go through the basics of a standard React application with help from [create-react-app (CRA)](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

This `master` branch represents a finished solution set.

By the end of this lab, you will have:

* Scaffolded your app using `create-react-app`
* Understood how CRA treats assets, JavaScript files, and the build process
* Understand how React maintains state and its event lifecycle
* Communicated with a Web API using `fetch`
* Implemented client-side routing with `react-router`
* Structured a React app for team maintainability
* Deployed a React app to Firebase Hosting

This `master` branch represents a completed solution set for the lab.  We have separated the lab into logical "breakpoints" by use of branches.  Please see below to get started.

# Dependencies and Suggested Tools
